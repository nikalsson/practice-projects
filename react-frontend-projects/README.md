## freeCodeCamp Front end projects

Made with using React
- Calculator, does the calculations using JavaScript eval()
- Random Quote Machine, uses Forismatic API for the quotes
- Markdown Previewer, uses marked.js for the conversion

Still to come:
- drum machine
- pomodoro clock

Things to fix, improve:
- The buttons buttons in the mode selector are bigger than the browser window, overflowing
- Return button to absorb the background color of the selected mode
